## MIDAS: Missile Interception Decision & Analysis System

> "Outsmarting threats before they strike." 

---

###  Introduction

Modern warfare is evolving — fast, stealthy, and unpredictable missile threats like **hypersonic missiles**, **cruise missiles**, and **drone swarms** render traditional defense systems ineffective. India’s current systems like **BMD** and **Aakash** were not designed to handle such next-gen challenges.

**MIDAS** (Missile Interception Decision and Analysis System) is a **real-time AI-powered defense prototype** designed to tackle these new-age threats using:

- **Machine Learning for threat classification**
- **Predictive analytics for trajectory prediction**
- **Simulation engines for interception strategy**
- **Real-time command dashboards**

Built for hackathons, MIDAS shows how AI can enhance national security systems by **detecting**, **analyzing**, and **neutralizing threats** — **autonomously**.

### Machine Learning Models Used

| Step | Model | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Missile Detection (YOLOv8) | Detect and classify missile types from images. |
| 2 | Threat Level Classifier | Rule-based or ML model to label threat as High/Medium/Low. |
| 3 | Path Prediction Model | Predict future missile trajectory. |
| 4 | Interception Simulation | Monte Carlo simulation to find optimal interception points. |
| 5 | Final Decision Engine | Choose best countermeasure automatically. |
| 6 | Risk Analysis (Optional) | Predict damage if interception fails. |
| 7 | Cybersecurity | Secure operation on private LAN (no external exposure). |

###  24-Hour Hackathon Implementation Plan

####  Phase 1: System Setup

- ✅ Setup **Java Spring Boot** backend with `/api/missile-data` endpoint.
- ✅ Create **React.js + Leaflet** frontend map centered on India.
- ✅ Build **Python missile simulator** to stream fake data (1 missile/sec).
- ✅ Establish **Private WiFi LAN** for offline, secure communication.
- ✅ Test end-to-end: Simulator ➔ Backend ➔ Frontend.

---

####  Phase 2: AI Core Modules

-  **Missile Detection**: Use **YOLOv8** to detect missiles from sample images.
-  **Path Prediction**: Simple linear prediction based on velocity + heading.
-  **Interception Simulation**: Monte Carlo simulations to simulate counter-attack.
-  **Threat Classification**: Rule-based classifier (e.g., speed > threshold = High threat).

---

####  Phase 3: Dashboard Enhancements

-  Use **dark-themed CartoDB** tiles for military-style look.
-  Show interception points dynamically on the map.
- �\dfef🟩 Color code missile icons by threat level.
-  Optional: Smooth missile movement animation.
-  Custom **missile icons** for realism.

---

#### 🧷 Phase 4: Final Prep & Demo

- ✅ Add **Cybersecurity Statement**: “Secure offline LAN mode.”
- ✅ Prepare clean 5-slide PPT:
  - Problem
  - Limitations of existing systems
  - MIDAS Solution
  - Live Demo
  - Future Work
- ✅ Assign speaking roles to each team member.
- ✅ Dry run the demo 2–3 times.
- ✅ Create backup video/screenshots in case of system crash.
